# To Get the working react app on your machine do these steps first!!

1 - clone the repo

2 - cd into the folder that was made when you cloned it (probably missionary-app I would assume)

3 - run "npm install"

4 - run "npm start" to see if it is working, hopefully you can open up site locally

5 - create a branch for yourself to make any changes
